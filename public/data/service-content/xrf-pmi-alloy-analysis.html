<h1 class="title">XRF/PMI Alloy Analysis</h1>
<p>
	Positive Material Identification (PMI) also referred as Material Verification, is an NDT method used to identify metal alloy element compositions with a portable x-ray fluorescence (XRF) alloy analyzer.
</p>
<p>
	PMI is performed on ferrous and non-ferrous metallic materials including welds, weld overlays, castings, forgings, valves and components, pipe, fittings, machined parts, pressure vessels, structural steel, and on components requiring certification to NACE MR0175.

<p>
	Surface preparation and cleanliness are essential when performing PMI, as the depth of penetration for element analysis is minimal.  Analyzers have a margin of error for element composition in low percentages that may vary depending on the activity of the equipmentâ€™s radioactive source.  PMI analyzers are limited to identifying only those alloys that are listed in the manufacturer's analyzer library, and should not be performed on material in excess of 200&deg;F (93.3&deg;C) unless specialized equipment and techniques are used.  X-ray fluorescence analyzers are unable to detect carbon, sulphur and phosphorus.
