<p>
	Pipeline Integrity Assessments conform to industry standards, client specifications, and CSA Z662 – Oil and Gas Pipeline Systems.  Inspection results complement and support our client’s pipeline integrity evaluation and rehabilitation in-line inspection programs.  Conventional and advanced inspections are used to obtain the most accurate data for identification and evaluation of anomalies, correlation interpretation of indications and repair verification.
