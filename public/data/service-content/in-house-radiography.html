	TriQuest NDT facilities allow us to perform all aspects of NDT in our shop quickly and efficiently for our clients that require offsite inspection.  We utilize three indoor radiography testing bunkers that are available 24/7.  The facility will accommodate large diameter pressure vessels loaded onto a full-size flat deck semi-trailer up to 65' long and 18’ high.  The facility also includes 1-5 Ton and 2-2.5 Ton cranes.

	Typical inspections include but are not limited to piping, pressure vessels, castings and structural steel.  Post Weld Heat Treatment (PWHT) items can be transported directly to the facility for inspection from the heat treating location and all aspects of the inspections can be performed prior to the return of the item to the client facility.
