<p>
	TriQuest NDT offers rope access for difficult or otherwise inaccessible areas that encompass a wide range of repair, maintenance, inspection and access work. This enhanced service optimizes costs for challenging industrial environments while maintaining the highest possible level of safety for our technicians, on-site personnel, and clients. Rope Access Technicians are highly trained and certified by IRATA (Industrial Rope Access Trade Association) or SPRAT (Society of Professional Rope Access Technicians) and adhere to the guidelines for safety, training, work quality and working practices. Our equipment is meticulously inspected, tested and certified to meet and or exceed OSHA and ANSI industry requirements.

	Every project is assessed, planned, and documented by the Level III Rope Access Supervisor to ensure a safe system of work is maintained at all times, mitigating damage to property or harm to the environment; careful planning and documented risk assessments are undertaken for each operation. Safety procedures are implemented and reviewed as well as site-specific rescue plans are developed, reviewed and implemented prior performing site-specific tasks.

	Redundant systems provide secondary fall protection and are implemented to ensure that the worker is protected by two independent rope systems; this is in compliance with IRATA and International Codes of Practice and SPRAT guidelines. The reportable incident rate for rope access technicians excellent and statistically significantly below that of industry workers that work at heights.

	Rope access has many advantages from the ability to safely accessing difficult areas, the speed in which tasks can be completed in those locations, low impact on other operations in the area, and the reduced cost for accessing locations in many cases.
