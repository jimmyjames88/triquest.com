<h1 class="title">Pulsed Eddy Current (PEC) Inspection</h1>
<p>
	Pulsed Eddy Current (PEC) is an NDT method that enables in-service inspections to identify areas of concern through coatings,
	 fireproofing, weather jackets, concrete, and insulation with little to no surface preparation achieving 100% inspection of
	 the wall thickness.
</p>
<p>
	Typical PEC inspection applications include piping, pressure vessels, tanks, spheres, fourdrinier beams, bleach towers, internal
	coating thickness measurement, structural steel, and stacks.
</p>
<p>
	This screening tool has a significant cost savings to our clients by reducing or eliminating the need for scaffolding, removal and
	replacement of insulation, reducing the critical inspection area, and our system has a single probe or an array probe for very fast
	data capture of large areas to enhance the productivity of the inspection examinations.
