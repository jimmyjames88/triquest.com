<p>
	Computed radiography (CR) produces digital images with the use of phosphor imaging plates in lieu of conventional film.  Digital radiography (DR) uses digital detector systems in which the images display directly on a computer screen, eliminating the need to intermediate scanning of imaging plates.
</p>
<p>
	All of TriQuest NDT’s CR and DR equipment is mobile.  This provides immediate on-site results for all applications regardless of the inspection location.  All labs are equipped with custom exposure equipment to provide high quality images at high production rates, either on the ground or in the air.
