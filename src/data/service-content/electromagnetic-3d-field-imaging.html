	Echo 3D is an Electro-Magnetic Field (EMF) technology using advanced Electro-Magnetic Field Imaging (EMFI) to measure, map and analyze electro-magnetic forces to detect surface breaking defects on ferrous and non-ferrous materials and can be used through coatings of up to 15mm (9/16”) in thickness.  This is a non-contact inspection method that does not require couplant (as in ultrasonic testing), and minimal surface preparation is required.  Scanning speeds greater than 500mm (19.68”) per second can be achieved to accurately plot and identify localized or general corrosion locations, Stress Corrosion Cracking (SCC) colony field sizes, and depth of the defects.  This technology is extremely efficient, accurate, and highly repeatable for pipe and plate applications for the detection and sizing of SCC, corrosion mapping, and crack depth sizing.  High resolution digital data is displayed in a three-dimensional C-Scan image, and the analysis software plots defect location, orientation and severity on the X, Y & Z axis.
